### MacOS

MacOS automatically extracts .zip files when they are downloaded.

If that's not the case, navigate to the .zip file in Finder and double click it. The contents should extract to a folder with the same name.

## 4) Run the kiosk or editor

### Windows

Inside the folder of the _extracted_ kiosk, double click `kiosk.jar` to start the kiosk or `editor.jar` to start the editor.

Windows may ask for permission to run the file. If Java is properly installed, the application will open. If you cannot open either application, check to make sure any installed antivirus isn't interfering.

### MacOS

Inside the folder of the _extracted_ kiosk, right click the `kiosk.jar` or `editor.jar` file and click `Open`. There may be a warning - simply continue through it by pressing `Open`.
